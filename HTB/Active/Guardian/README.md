**OS:** Linux

**Status:** ⏳ Active — Full write-up locked until retirement

## Overview (No Spoilers)
**Guardian** presents a hardened portal with tight service constraints and careful config hygiene. Expect targeted web recon, disciplined enumeration, and a creative escalation that rewards attention to how services are started and restricted.

This page is a *teaser only* to avoid spoilers while the box is active. The full walkthrough will publish automatically after retirement.

---

## What You’ll Practice
- Focused web enumeration under restricted conditions
- Reading & validating service configuration safely
- Chaining small misconfigurations into meaningful access
- Post-access hygiene and escalation mindset

---

## Suggested Prep (General, Non‑spoiler)
- Review **Linux permissions**, service users, and systemd/daemon start patterns  
- Brush up on **Apache basics** (vhosts, include paths, privilege boundaries)  
- Have a checklist for **local enumeration** (users, configs, scheduled tasks, unusual binaries)

## Publication Policy
Per HTB rules, we do not publish active-box solutions. This page will unlock the complete write‑up when **Guardian** retires. Until then, you can bookmark this link:

**Future full write-up:** https://github.com/inkedqt/ctf-writeups/tree/main/HTB/Guardian

> If the link 404s while the box is active, that’s expected.
