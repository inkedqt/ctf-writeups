# HackNet – HTB Box (Teaser)

**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Platform:** Hack The Box – *Machine*  
**Write-up:** Redacted until/unless HTB allows public solutions.

## 🧭 Overview
A slick Django social app with one critical mistake: server-side template data rendered inside a “likes” fragment. That sink, paired with an IDOR, exposes credentials for a real system user; from there, a world-writable Django file cache enables a pickle deserialization hop to the web user. Final escalation comes from encrypted DB backups left with their GPG key—crack the passphrase, decrypt, and you’re holding the route to root.

## 🧪 What I Can Share (No Spoilers)
- **Foothold:** Username rendered in a template → **SSTI**; combined with a “likes” endpoint → credential disclosure → SSH as the intended foothold user.  
- **Lateral:** Django **FileBasedCache** under `/var/tmp/django_cache` is world-writable → replace a fresh cache file with a **pickle** payload → code exec as the web app user.  
- **PrivEsc:** Encrypted SQL backups plus the matching **GPG key** are on the box → crack the key’s passphrase, **decrypt**, recover creds, and pivot to **root**.

---

## 🧠 Takeaways
- Template sinks + IDORs are a nasty combo—**rendered user input** in server templates is game over.
- World-writable caches aren’t harmless scratch space; **pickle loads** equals RCE.
- Backups + keys on the same host are an **inevitable** escalation path—separate and lock them down.

## 📌 Notes
No payloads or credential values are published here by design. If HTB permits public walkthroughs in the future, I’ll release a full write-up with defensive guidance.
