## Overview (No Spoilers)
**Previous** is a modern web challenge that rewards careful API testing and disciplined note‑taking. Expect to read behavior more than banners, think about boundaries, and connect a few small, non‑obvious dots to progress. Post‑access work emphasizes clean escalation habits without relying on guesswork.

This page is a *teaser only* to avoid spoilers while the box is active. The full walkthrough will publish after retirement.

---

## What You’ll Practice
- Targeted web/API enumeration and response analysis
- Recognizing trust boundaries and validating assumptions safely
- Sensible credential/secret hygiene and environment awareness
- Linux escalation mindset (services, configs, hooks)

---

## Suggested Prep (General, Non‑spoiler)
- Refresh HTTP tooling (browser devtools, curl, Burp/ffuf basics)  
- Brush up on modern JavaScript/web‑app reading (routing, handlers, middleware)  
- Review a standard Linux privesc checklist (service users, timers, PATH/use of sudo)  
- Keep a reproducible, step‑by‑step notes workflow

## Publication Policy
Per HTB rules, we don’t publish active‑box solutions. This page will unlock the complete write‑up when **Previous** retires. Until then, you can bookmark this link:

**Future full write‑up:** https://github.com/inkedqt/ctf-writeups/tree/main/HTB/Previous

> If the link 404s while the box is active, that’s expected.
