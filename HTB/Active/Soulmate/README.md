## 🧩 Summary

Soulmate combined a **CrushFTP exploit** with **custom Erlang components** for an interesting and layered attack path. After discovering **ftp.soulmate.htb**, we leveraged **CVE-2025-31161** to create an **admin user** in CrushFTP and reset existing credentials. With **RCE** achieved via a PHP backdoor, we escalated to **SSH access** and finally abused a **custom Erlang-based login service** to execute system commands as **root**.

## 🛠️ Exploit Chain

**Subdomain discovery → CrushFTP admin RCE → password reset → PHP webshell → SSH creds → Erlang shell → root**
