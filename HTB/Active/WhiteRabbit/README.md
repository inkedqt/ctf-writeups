## Overview (No Spoilers)
WhiteRabbit is a beautifully layered Active Directory-adjacent Linux challenge that rewards *methodical recon* and *careful reading*. Expect to follow subtle breadcrumbs from a seemingly quiet surface into a chain that mixes:
- discovery of ‚Äúhidden‚Äù service views,
- crafting correctly signed requests,
- automating a noisy step to prove a point,
- a clever pivot through backup workflows,
- and a finale that hinges on reasoning about time and randomness.

This page is a teaser only to avoid spoilers while the box is active. The full walkthrough will publish automatically after retirement.

## What You‚Äôll Practice
- **Subdomain & service enumeration** that goes beyond standard wordlists
- **Signed webhook flows** (building/verifying request signatures; tamper‚Äësafe testing)
- **Automating manual checks** (light scripting/extension work to eliminate human error)
- **Backup/restore tooling workflows** and safe data handling
- **Time/PRNG intuition** and reproducible verification techniques

## Suggested Prep (General, Non‚Äëspoiler)
- Review HMAC basics and how signature headers are constructed & validated.
- Brush up on **HTTP tooling** (Burp macros/extensions, curl, Python helpers).
- Get comfortable with **repository‚Äëstyle backup tools** and snapshot restores.
- Revisit PRNG seeding concepts (C `rand` vs. language libraries) and how time is represented (seconds vs. ms/us).

## Publication Policy
Per HTB rules, we do not publish active‚Äëbox solutions. This page will unlock the complete write‚Äëup when WhiteRabbit retires. Until then, you can bookmark this link:

**Future full write‚Äëup:** https://github.com/inkedqt/ctf-writeups/tree/main/HTB/Active/WhiteRabbit

If the link 404s while the box is active, that‚Äôs expected.
