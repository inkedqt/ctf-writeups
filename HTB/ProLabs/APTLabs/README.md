# APTLabs – HTB Pro Lab (Teaser)

**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Platform:** Hack The Box – *Pro Lab*  
**Write-up:** Redacted until/unless HTB allows public solutions (Pro Labs stay secret).

---

## 🧭 Overview
APTLabs felt like a classic enterprise perimeter-to-domain takeover. You chain small footholds into an AD pivot, then leverage graph insights for a clean finish. Crisp, methodical, and very “real world.”

---

## 🧪 What I Can Share (No Spoilers)
- Practical **external foothold** → internal **AD** pivot
- **Credential discovery/reuse** and **ACL** misconfigurations
- **BloodHound** path validation and tidy escalation
- Emphasis on **opsec** and minimal-noise enumeration

---

## 🧠 Takeaways
- Treat every tiny lead as a **link in a chain**
- **Access control** mistakes in AD are everywhere—graph them
- Keep notes tight; the shortest path wins

## 📌 Notes
No walkthrough here by design. If HTB ever green-lights public write-ups, I’ll publish a full breakdown with proper defensive countermeasures.
