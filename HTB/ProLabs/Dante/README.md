# Dante – HTB Pro Lab (Teaser)

**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Platform:** Hack The Box – *Pro Lab*  
**Write-up:** Redacted until/unless HTB allows public solutions (Pro Labs stay secret).

---

## 🧭 Overview
Dante is a great mixed-estate journey—Linux and Windows interplay, careful loot reuse, and a tidy path into AD dominance without gimmicks.

---

## 🧪 What I Can Share (No Spoilers)
- **Perimeter recon** → foothold via practical misconfigs
- **Cred reuse** and **pivoting** across OS boundaries
- AD **enumeration** and **GPO/ACL** leverage
- Clean, auditable escalation to **DA**

---

## 🧠 Takeaways
- Keep creds organized; **reuse** wins when mapped well
- OS “seams” are where the fun often hides
- Privilege comes from **relationships**, not just exploits

## 📌 Notes
No walkthrough here by design. If HTB ever green-lights public write-ups, I’ll publish a full breakdown with proper defensive countermeasures.
