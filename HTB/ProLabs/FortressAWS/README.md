# Fortress AWS – HTB Pro Lab (Teaser)

**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Platform:** Hack The Box – *Pro Lab*  
**Write-up:** Redacted until/unless HTB allows public solutions (Pro Labs stay secret).

---

## 🧭 Overview
Fortress AWS is a tight cloud-first lab—**IAM** gotchas, **priv-esc** via policies/roles, and real-world **SSM/S3** workflows that mirror production.

---

## 🧪 What I Can Share (No Spoilers)
- **IAM** misconfigs → privilege escalation
- **SSM** pivots, **S3** data handling, and cloud persistence
- Guardrails vs mis-scoped permissions
- Least-privilege mindset in practice

---

## 🧠 Takeaways
- Read every policy—**the diff matters**
- Enumerate via CLI **and** console for full context
- Log trails tell the story; keep artifacts clean

## 📌 Notes
No walkthrough here by design. If HTB ever green-lights public write-ups, I’ll publish a full breakdown with proper defensive countermeasures.
