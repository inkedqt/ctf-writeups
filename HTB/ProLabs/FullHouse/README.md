# FullHouse – HTB Mini Pro Labs (Teaser)

**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Platform:** Hack The Box – *Mini Pro Lab*  
**Write-up:** Redacted until/unless HTB allows public solutions (Pro Labs stay secret).

---

## 🧭 Overview
FullHouse was a fast-paced, multi-discipline lab that strings together real-world misconfigurations and code quirks across web, Windows, AD, and some curve-balls. Think: *read the source, chain the small things, and never forget the basics*.

---

## 🧪 What I Can Share (No Spoilers)
- Solid **source review** moments that reward careful reading
- **Web app logic** pitfalls and auth edge cases
- Practical **Windows + AD** enumeration and abuse
- A touch of **reversing** for signal, not noise
- Fun side quests (👀 **AI bypass** & **blockchain** components—lightweight but clever)

> If you’re prepping for enterprise work, this lab is an excellent “glue everything together” rep.

---

## 🧠 Takeaways
- Small misconfigs compound—**chain-building beats single-shot exploits**
- Logs + error messages are breadcrumbs; **read everything**
- Speed is nice; **signal discipline** wins

## 📌 Notes
No walkthrough here by design. If HTB ever green-lights public write-ups, I’ll publish a full breakdown with proper defensive countermeasures.
