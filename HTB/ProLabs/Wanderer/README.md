# Wanderer – HTB Pro Lab (Teaser)

**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Platform:** Hack The Box – *Pro Lab*  
**Write-up:** Redacted until/unless HTB allows public solutions (Pro Labs stay secret).

---

## 🧭 Overview
Wanderer mixes web/container seams with AD edges. It’s about reading boundaries, crossing them cleanly, and leaving a tidy audit trail.

---

## 🧪 What I Can Share (No Spoilers)
- **Web** foothold → **container/segmentation** escape
- Controlled **pivot** into AD
- Practical **priv-esc** and path validation
- Good practice for “defense-aware” ops

---

## 🧠 Takeaways
- Boundaries are clues—**containers** can be springboards
- Don’t over-rotate: **shortest safe path** beats novelty
- Keep artifacts lean for easy reporting

## 📌 Notes
No walkthrough here by design. If HTB ever green-lights public write-ups, I’ll publish a full breakdown with proper defensive countermeasures.
