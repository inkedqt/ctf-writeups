Zephyr – HTB Pro Lab (Teaser)
Status: ✅ Completed
Platform: Hack The Box – Pro Lab
Write-up: Redacted until/unless HTB allows public solutions (Pro Labs stay secret).

🧭 Overview
Zephyr blends perimeter mapping with multi-network pivots and mature AD ramp-up. It’s a test of patient mapping, careful trust-abuse, and doing the right small step that opens the next door.

🧪 What I Can Share (No Spoilers)
- Perimeter foothold → methodical internal pivoting  
- Chained web/service footholds that lead to an internal tool you’ll want to inspect  
- AD enumeration and practical escalation paths (service accounts, scheduled tasks, certs/delegation)  
- Defensive reminders: logging, least-privilege, and segmentation checks

🧠 Takeaways
- Map networks first — the environment often points to the shortest safe path  
- Small tooling mistakes (schedules, backup tooling, weak service accounts) compound quickly  
- Validate pivots with minimal noise so you can reproduce and report effectively

📌 Notes
No walkthrough here by design. If HTB flips its policy on Pro Lab write-ups, I’ll publish a full, defense-aware breakdown with mitigation notes.
