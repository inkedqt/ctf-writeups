## 🧠 Teaser

What happens when a seemingly harmless game skin site hides an enterprise deployment tool behind closed doors?  
Let’s just say… we found the keys to the castle – and the drawbridge was operated via XML-RPC.

From cracking questionable password choices to tunneling into forgotten services, this box rewards patient enumeration and a willingness to poke at dusty sysadmin tools.

---

## 🪛 Tools You'll Want:

- 🔍 `ffuf` or `feroxbuster` for web content discovery  
- 🐍 `python3` for custom XML-RPC interaction scripts  
- 🪓 `john` for SHA-256 hash cracking  
- 🚇 `ssh -L` for pivoting into internal services  
- 📜 `curl` for quick XML-RPC testing

---

## ✅ You'll Need to:

- 🕵️ Enumerate and find SQL injection points  
- 🗄️ Dump and crack admin hashes  
- 🔐 Use SSH tunneling to expose an internal Cobbler service  
- 📂 Abuse template file fetches to leak sensitive files  
- 👑 Read `/root/root.txt` without ever popping a traditional root shell
