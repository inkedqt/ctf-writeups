🧠 Teaser

A simple text editor? Or a ticking time bomb of broken logic and hidden payloads...

Are you savvy enough to trace the input validation flaws, disassemble the binary protections, and take full control of the system?

🪛 Tools You'll Want:

🕸️ Burp Suite or ZAP for intercepting funky input  
🔍 Strings, Ghidra or GDB for cracking the binary open  
📦 Python3 + `pickle` for sneaky deserialization  
🐚 Your favorite Linux privesc enumeration tools (linPEAS, pspy, etc.)

You'll need to:

📥 Fuzz inputs and watch for hidden system calls  
💣 Identify and exploit logic bombs in a homebrew interpreter  
🔓 Abuse insecure deserialization to get a shell  
📜 Traverse limited environments to escalate privileges  
🔁 Leverage overlooked system tools to overwrite root
