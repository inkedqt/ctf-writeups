# Expressway – HTB Seasonal (Teaser)

**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Platform:** Hack The Box – *Season 9* (Easy • Linux)  
**Write-up:** Redacted until/unless HTB allows public solutions.

## 🧭 Overview
VPN-first box with a twist: Aggressive Mode IKE on UDP/500 gives you just enough to move from recon to a real foothold. From there, privilege escalation hinges on reading the environment—not just running an off‑the‑shelf script.

---

## 🧪 What I Can Share (No Spoilers)
- **Recon:** UDP/500 (ISAKMP/IKE) + NAT‑T exposed; Aggressive Mode handshake is capturable.  
- **Foothold:** IKE Aggressive Mode → PSK capture → crack → valid user identified as `ike` → SSH in.  
- **Privesc:** Sudo nuance rather than kernel tricks; a hostname hint in logs unlocks root with a clean, single‑line command.

> If you’re practicing real‑world pace and restraint, this one rewards careful reads over noise.

---

## 🧠 Takeaways
- Don’t skip UDP. IKE on **500/udp** often pays off.
- When enum tools are quiet, scan the **logs** and **config** for environment‑specific breadcrumbs.
- Quote carefully and prefer built‑in tools (`ssh`, `sudo`) for a low‑noise finish.
