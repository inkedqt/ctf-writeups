## 🧠 Teaser

A domain full of policies, delegation edge cases, and a rusty trust chain...

Can you untangle a messy AD forest where *support is protected*, but *old credentials remain dangerous*?

🪛 Bring your favorite tools:
- 🩸 BloodHound
- 🧪 SharpHound
- 🛠️ RunasCs
- 🗂️ ccache + Kerberos S4U
- ⚙️ Impacket's `getST.py`, `smbexec.py`

You'll need to:
- Identify a misconfigured delegation edge 🕵️
- Abuse **GenericWrite** and **ForceChangePassword** 💥
- Evade *Protected Users* 🤫
- Chain it all for **Domain Admin**
