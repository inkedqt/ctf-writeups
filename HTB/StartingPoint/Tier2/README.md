**Platform:** Hack The Box  
**Track:** Starting Point Tier 2  
**Difficulty:** Introductory / Beginner-Friendly  

---

## Overview

This tier builds on the basics of Tier 0 and Tier 1 and introduces additional techniques including more advanced web exploitation, JWT cracking, LFI and XXE attacks, SUID privilege escalation, and SMB/WinRM flows.

## Completed Boxes

| Box Name    | Status   | Notes |
|-------------|----------|-------|
| Archetype   |          | SMB enumeration → credentials → WinRM foothold |
| Oopsie      |          | File upload vulnerability → RCE via uploaded PHP |
| Vaccine     |          | Local file inclusion → privilege escalation via sudo misconfig |
| Unified     |          | JWT cracking → admin access → reverse shell |
| Included    |          | XXE injection → LFI → RCE via malicious XML |
| Markup      |          | LFI → reading sensitive files → SSH access |
| Base        |          | SUID binary privilege escalation → root shell |
